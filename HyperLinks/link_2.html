      The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since
      then, there have been many different versions of HTML. The most widely
      used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which became an official
      standard in December 1999.Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as
      an XML language. Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML
      language. XML is a standard markup language that is used to create other
      markup languages. Hundreds of XML languages are in use today, including
      GML (Geography Markup Language), MathML, MusicML, and RSS (Really Simple
      Syndication). Since each of these languages was written in a common
      language (XML), their content can easily be shared across applications.
      This makes XML potentially very powerful, and it's no surprise that the
      W3C would create an XML version of HTML (again, called XHTML). XHTML
      became an official standard in 2000, and was updated in 2002. XHTML is
      very similar to HTML, but has stricter rules. Strict rules are necessary
      for all XML languages, because without it, interoperability between
      applications would be impossible. You'll learn more about the differences
      between HTML and XHTML
